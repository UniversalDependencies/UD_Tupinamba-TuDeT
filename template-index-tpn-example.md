<!-- Inspired by an old proposal for language-specific documentation here: http://universaldependencies.org/v2/minimaldoc.html
     If we agree on a scheme like this, the old proposal should be updated and made visible in the “How to Contribute” section;
     right now it is probably not linked from anywhere. -->
