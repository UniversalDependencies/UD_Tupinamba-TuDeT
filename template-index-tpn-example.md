<!-- Inspired by an old proposal for language-specific documentation here: http://universaldependencies.org/v2/minimaldoc.html
     If we agree on a scheme like this, the old proposal should be updated and made visible in the “How to Contribute” section;
     right now it is probably not linked from anywhere. -->

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* In general, words are delimited by whitespace characters. Description of exceptions follows.
* According to typographical rules, many punctuation marks are attached to a neighboring word. We always tokenize them as separate tokens (words).
* LEMMA - the stem of words are given without the referential (also called argument) marker: _ɨgara_ is given as _ɨgar_ .

<!--**Instruction**: Describe the general rules for delimiting words (for example, based on whitespace and punctuation) and exceptions to these rules. Specify whether words with spaces and/or multiword tokens occur. Include links to further language-specific documentation if available. -->
